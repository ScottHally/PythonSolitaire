# PythonSolitaire

Just a dumb CLI based Solitaire game

If you actually want to try it, download the code, then:

  - From the directory, run python main.py
  - Enter a  number listed to execute the desired move
  - Press c to cycle the deck
  - Currently you cannot undo moves or move from the home pile back to the 'field'
  - Enter Q or q to stop playing
